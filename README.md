# Guessing

This is a guessing game in which the user is asked yes or no questions regarding the author. The user must type in "yes", "Yes", "YES", "y", or  "Y" to answer yes, or "no", "No", "NO", "n", or "N" to answer no to the three questions. The code resides in game.js, and the game is run by running index.html.

I didn't want to believe that my friend was a construction sign thief, but when I got home all the signs were there.
